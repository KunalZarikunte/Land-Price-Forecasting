# Land Price Forecasting:
This project is focused on forecasting land prices using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict the future prices of land based on various factors such as location, size, type of property, and economic indicators.

# Project Description:
The project uses a dataset of historical land prices that have been collected from various sources such as government records, real estate agents, and property websites. The dataset contains information on land properties such as location, size, type of property, and date of sale.

The project involves the following steps:

Data preprocessing: cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
Feature engineering: selecting and creating relevant features that will help in predicting the land prices.
Model selection: choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict the land prices.
Model training: training the selected machine learning algorithm on the dataset.
Model evaluation: evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).
Forecasting: using the trained model to forecast the future prices of land.
